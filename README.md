# Sprintr

Welcome to Sprintr!

Sprintr is Chrome browser extension and web app built by [Tim Chew](http://www.github.com/timothyrchew),  [Jeannie Yamakawa](http://www.github.com/JeannieYamakawa), and [Robert Varela](http://www.github.com/rvarela11) in the course of a week. 

Our goal was to incentiveize productivity through creating a Chrome browser extension and web application that allows users to create "sprints," or competitions, that track friends' time spent on productive websites. 

We taught ourselves AngularJS the week prior to beginning the project, and then built Sprintr on:
* Node.js
* Express
* AngularJS
* PostgreSQL

*Hard work pays off. Let's sprint together.*


##  Create a Sprint

* Pick a start and end date for your sprint. 
* Designate the productive websites you would like to track during the course of the Sprint. 
* If you would like to up the stakes, designate your Sprint as a cash game. This will require all players to contribute to a cash pot (through Dwolla). The winner of the sprint takes home the pot.
